###Conway's Game of Life using Genetic Algorithm

This is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life. The Genetic Algorithm is implemented using C++.

The code was initially written in javascript but the integration of GA caused some problem and froze the browser. So, I rewrote the code in C++.

I will be using javascript to visualize the Conway's Game of Life.
